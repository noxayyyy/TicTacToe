# tic-tac-toe

Welcome to tic-tac-toe created in C++ by Tamta Asatiani.

The main goal of this project was to get comfortable with C++
I have prior coding experience in game development, so I believe looking at this project will be most of use to those who have prior knowledge in programming (I use OOP here) and want to get acquinted with C++

This project doesn't really use game programming patterns (aside from a very simple implementation of gamestates) so no prior game development knowledge is required.
Good luck in your learning!
